Welcome to my website! My name is Junhao Liu (刘峻豪), and I am a Senior Lecturer in Accounting at the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne.

My research interests broadly pertain to archival research in financial accounting, and I am particularly interested in accounting intangibles, financial reporting and disclosure, financial analysts, and valuation.

My current research focuses on accounting intangibles in the digital economy, including but not limited to (1) accounting for and disclosure of data assets and other intangibles, (2) the role of data in financial reporting, (3) implications of data privacy and security issues for accounting. I was selected as a FASB Emerging Scholar Finalist for my dissertation work on accounting intangibles (data resources). 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in accounting from Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I earned my B.A. and M.A. degrees in accounting from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

In my spare time, I am an amateur photographer who enjoys hunting photos in cities. Besides, I also enjoy cooking, singing, and exploring museums.
