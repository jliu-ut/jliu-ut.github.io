Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in accounting at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. I am on the 2023 - 2024 academic job market.

My research interests broadly pertain to archival research in financial accounting and cover financial accounting and disclosure, financial analysts, and ESG (especially the "S" component). In particular, my current research focuses on accounting issues in the landscape of digital economy, and I am interested in understanding the role of big data and data analytics in accounting, the valuation and reporting of data assets, as well as the implication of data privacy and security issues for accounting. I was selected as a FASB Emerging Scholar Finalist for my dissertation work.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I earned my B.A. and M.A. degrees in accounting from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

In my spare time, I am an amateur photographer who enjoys hunting photos in cities. Besides, I also enjoy cooking, singing, weight training, and spending time with my beautiful cat Suda.
