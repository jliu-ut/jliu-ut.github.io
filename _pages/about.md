I am a Ph.D. Candidate in accounting at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. I will join the University of Melbourne as a Senior Lecturer in Accounting soon.

My current research focuses on accounting issues related to digital economy, and I am particularly interested in understanding the role of big data and data analytics in accounting, the valuation and reporting of data assets, as well as implications of data privacy and security issues for accounting. I was selected as a FASB Emerging Scholar Finalist for my dissertation work. 

In addition, my research interests broadly pertain to archival research in financial accounting, and I am interested in financial reporting and disclosure, ESG (especially the "S" component), financial analysts, and valuation.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I earned my B.A. and M.A. degrees in accounting from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

In my spare time, I am an amateur photographer who enjoys hunting photos in cities. Besides, I also enjoy cooking, singing, exploring museums, fitness training, and spending time with my beautiful cat Suda.
