### Teaching Interests
I am particularly interested in teaching data analytics for accounting majors at all levels using tools including Microsoft Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I am also interested in and able to teach a wide range of courses including financial accounting, managerial accounting, and financial statement analysis.
